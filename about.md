Indonesian. Dreamer. Networker Enthusiast. I'm focused on learning IT network & security. I love to do research and development with IT stuff. So I'm started to type and share some documentation here. I set my heart as UDP to everyone, and only spreaded out a single multicast without splitting the horizon in between. And by the way this is my first blog. Happy config, and enjoy the horizon.
